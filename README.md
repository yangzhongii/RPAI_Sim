# RPAI_Sim:Robotic Photoacoustic Imaging Simulation Framework Based on ROS
## Coming soon by August 20th

Photoacoustic (PA) imaging, a hybrid modality
combining optical absorption contrast with acoustic penetraï¿¾tion, holds significant potential for non-invasive visualization
of peripheral vessels, particularly in image-guided robotic
surgical applications. However, the development of robotic PA
imaging systems is hindered by the complexity of acoustic wave
propagation and the lack of a dedicated simulation platform.
To address this, we introduce RPAI-Sim, the first ROS-based
simulation framework tailored for robotic PA imaging, enabling
the generation of raw PA data and images under arbitrary
probe poses. RPAI-Sim integrates a 3D PA phantom, the k-Wave
toolbox, and a robot controller to simulate signal propagation,
detection, and reconstruction in 2D and 3D domains for any
pose of PA probe
